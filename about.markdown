Hi Everyone, my name is Calvin and i’ve been practising data science since 2015. Like many of you, I didn’t start out as a data scientist in my career. Data science was a relatively niche field in Singapore back in 2011. I studied Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) at the National University of Singapore (NUS), focusing on operations research, statistics and computing. I subsequently pursued a Masters in Computing at NUS, focusing on general computer science and machine learning topics.

My first exposure to data science was through this course titled [The Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/the-analytics-edge) by EDX. I was enamoured by the applications of data science to solve problems by generating predictions. Needless to say, i was hooked and i have not looked back ever since.

Here’s a quick view of my data science journey to date:

* 2021 – 2023 –> Senior Customer Facing Data Scientist @ DataRobot
* 2020 – 2021 –> Senior Data Scientist/ Tech lead @ Singtel
* 2015 – 2019 –> Senior Data Scientist @ NCS
* 2011 – 2015 –> Technology Consultant @ Singtel
